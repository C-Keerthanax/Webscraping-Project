Hey this is small project done for Webscraping:
Requests - Library to make HTTP requests
 Beautiful Soup (often abbreviated as bs4) is a Python library used for parsing (analyzing a text or data in order to extract meaningful information ) HTML and XML documents and extracting data from them in a hierarchical and readable manner.

âœ…HTTP STATUS RESPONSES:
Informational - Request received, continuing process. (100-199)
Success - The action was successfully received, understood, and accepted.(200-299)
Redirection - Further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request.(300-399)
Client Error - The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.(400-499)
Server Error - The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.(500-599)

Data collected was structured into dictionaries for organization and manipulation. Converted collected data into an Excel sheet format using to_csv command, likely through a library such as pandas, for further analysis or presentation.
